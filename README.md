# WEBPRO_Project

This is my Webpro's Team Project. Duplicate of "TUMBLR" and named it with "Pic-Q" (Lula's idea)

How to run :
1. Use localhost from XAMPP
2. `import database to phpmyadmin`
3. Move project folder to `htdocs` folder in xampp folder
4. Change base_url from `localhost/Pic-Q/` into your folder name
5. Start the `Apache` and `MySQL` in XAMPP
6. Run `localhost/"your_folder"`
